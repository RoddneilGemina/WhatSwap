## Features

### User/Account Management  
The platform provides robust account management, allowing users to create accounts with unique usernames and passwords securely. Users can log in to access the system and fully manage their accounts by creating, reading, updating, or deleting their profiles, giving them complete control and flexibility over their account details.  

### User Profile  
Users can personalize their profiles by adding personal information, catalogs of items available for trade or auction, and other optional details. Each profile showcases user ratings and reviews, fostering a transparent and reliable community. Furthermore, users can rate and review others to maintain a trustworthy ecosystem on the platform.  

### Bidding  
The platform supports an interactive bidding system where users can browse auctioned items and place valid bids. This feature creates an engaging, competitive environment for users to bid for items of interest and actively participate in auctions.  

### Auctioning  
Users can list items for auction with comprehensive options to define bidding parameters, including start and end times and valid price ranges. For greater flexibility, auctions without predefined end times can be manually closed by the seller when needed.  

### Trading  
The trading feature allows users to upload items for trade, accompanied by detailed descriptions and customizable terms, such as negotiable conditions and logistical preferences (e.g., location or billing). Users maintain control over their listings, with options to mark items as unavailable or remove them entirely.  

### Accepting Trades  
This feature lets users browse and explore trade offers, send trade requests, and apply for trades that interest them. Users can negotiate by accepting or rejecting trade proposals from others, enabling dynamic and seamless trading interactions on the platform.
